title: Now
---
This is what I am supposedly working on now. Last updated in August, 2018.

## General
* I'm a developer at [Infi](https://infi.nl), so that's were I spend most of my time actually making things.
* Over nine months ago I moved, and I am still unpacking. That's not as much an activity as the word implies, it's just… every now and then I unpack a another box and put the contents somewhere nicer.
* The coding dojo I was working on in the last update is done! It was great, and ~~we're writing~~ we've written a series of blogposts about it. [Here's the start of the series](https://infi.nl/nieuws/coding-dojo-.net-core-op-mac-os-x-en-linux-1/).
* We did a programming class for novices. The weapon of choice is Ruby, which is also new for me. Can't honestly say I like Ruby much, but at this level it was easily accessible. Of course, there's also a [blog post](https://infi.nl/nieuws/iedereen-kan-leren-programmeren/) about this!

## Reading
* [Procedural Generation in Game Design](https://www.crcpress.com/Procedural-Generation-in-Game-Design/Short-Adams/p/book/9781498799195). Each chapter is another case from practise by a different game designer, which makes it a really interesting read.
* [Mastering Bitcoin](https://bitcoinbook.info/), because I get the big picture but not how it actually works. A little over halfway in, and I've got a lot of detail of the stuff which I already understood so, hm. I planned to have finished it by the end of June though (and we've just polished of July now), so I better get a move on.
* I recently read [White Rabbit, Red Wolf](http://www.walker.co.uk/White-Rabbit-Red-Wolf-9781406378177.aspx), which was quite fun although I didn't find the ending very satisfying.
* I just finished [Artemis](http://www.andyweirauthor.com/books/artemis-tr), the new novel by Andy Weir. It's a lot of fun, and I honestly can't wait for the film. I agree with Andy, who said:
  > I’d love to see the visual representation of the city itself. It would be a fantastic visual.

## Audiobooks
* [Sherlock Holmes: The Definitive Collection](http://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Crime-Thrillers/Sherlock-Holmes-The-Definitive-Collection-Audiobook/B06X1BRZYC) by Arthur C. Doyle (read by the excellent [Stephen Fry](http://www.stephenfry.com/)). It's been here for a while, that's because it's really off and on.
* [The Chaos Balance](http://www.lemodesittjr.com/the-books/saga-recluce/chaos-balance/), the seventh book of the Saga of Recluce series which I am quite fond of. The books are read by [Kirby Hayborne](http://kirbyheyborne.com/), who is an excellent narrator and a great fit.

## Playing
* I really want to continue [Lone Echo](http://www.readyatdawn.com/game-list/lone-echo/), which is so far (which is not really far) the best game I played in VR. Highly engaging, great use of VR and it allows you to set your own pace most of the time. Only, in this summer heat my game room is a _sauna_ which is not a place where you'd want to put on a VR headset.
* [Quern](http://querngame.com/) which is a nice puzzler, very remeniscent of Myst. It won't run on my puny MacBook though so it also has to be played in the sauna, which I don't. I am looking forward to finishing it!
* [Night in the Woods](http://www.nightinthewoods.com/). It is lovely and kind of strange and I absolutely love the [Dusk Stars song](https://youtu.be/dsoOxrCqbmg).
* I recently picked up [Syberia 3](http://www.syberia.microids.com/EN/) which we all have been looking forward to for about 10 years. Not really far in but it is _so bugridden_ and the interface is frankly terrible. I want to love it but it's hard to get into it.
* [Animal Crossing](http://animal-crossing.com/) on the Switch, but only in my sweetest dreams.

## Watching
* I picked up [Archer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1486217/) after an hiatus of several months. More of the same, but still fun.
* [The Expanse](http://www.syfy.com/theexpanse) is really awesome. I love how the series is both the same and different from the books.
* I restarted watching [Westworld](https://www.hbo.com/westworld) at series 1 because it's been a while and series 2 is out.

This page was inspired by [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com), and other people who have one (or really the reverse, because that's how I found out).
