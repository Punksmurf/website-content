title: Now
---
This is what I am supposedly working on now. Last updated in September, 2017.

## General
* I'm a developer at [Infi](https://infi.nl), so thats were I spend most of my time actually making things.
* Not much else. Things have been hectic recently. And most of my stuff is in boxes.

## Reading
Not really making much progress with anything, really.

## Audiobooks
* [Caliban's War](https://www.jamessacorey.com/books/calibans-war/) by James S.A. Corey (read by [Jefferson Mays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Mays)) and
* [Sherlock Holmes: The Definitive Collection](http://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Crime-Thrillers/Sherlock-Holmes-The-Definitive-Collection-Audiobook/B06X1BRZYC) by Arthur C. Doyle (read by the excellent [Stephen Fry](http://www.stephenfry.com/).

## Playing
* [Slime Rancher](http://slimerancher.com/) which is funny and lighthearted and cute and
* [Shadowrun Returns](http://harebrained-schemes.com/games/) after having abandoned it unjustly a few years ago

## Watching
* [White Collar](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1358522/),
* [Doctor Who](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436992/) and
* [Archer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1486217/).

This page was inspired by [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com), and other people who have one (or really the reverse, because that's how I found out).

Curious about what I did before _now_? Check this file's [history on GitHub](https://github.com/Punksmurf/website-content/commits/master/content/now/index.md)!
