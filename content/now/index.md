title: Now
---
This is what I am supposedly working on now. Last updated in April, 2017.

## General
* I'm a developer at [Infi](https://infi.nl), so thats were I spend most of my time actually making things.
* With some collegues we are playing neural networking and trying to get the hang of it. Luckily the software to do that is getting quite user friendly at this point, especially [Keras](https://keras.io) is amazing. Having just bought a gaming PC with a moderately powerful graphics card (a GTX 1060) helps too, because man is that stuff computationally intensive.
* I am reading [Domain Driven Design](https://www.bol.com/nl/p/domain-driven-design/1001004001984629/) by Eric Evans. It's a tough one to get trough, but also very inspiring.
* Recently, I bought my first synthesizer. With the wisdom of all my years I choose a [Volca FM](http://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/volca_fm/) which is an FM synth. If you know, like, anything at all about synths then you know an FM synth is not quite the best choice for a beginner. So, it's a challenge.
* A for now secret project with [Micha]().
* Creating a new website (you're looking at it now).

## Reading
* Trying to work through my backlog of [Donald Duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Duck_(Dutch_comic_book) comics (a quick count showed 93 to go, at 25 minutes a piece that's roughly 40h of reading),
* [Makers](http://craphound.com/makers/download/) by Cory Doctorow and
* [Modernist Cuisine at Home](http://modernistcuisine.com/books/modernist-cuisine-at-home/) by [Nathan Myhrvold](http://www.nathanmyhrvold.com) and his team.

## Audiobooks
* [The Order War](http://www.lemodesittjr.com/the-books/saga-recluce/order-war/) by L.E. Modesitt Jr (read by [Kirby Hayborne](http://www.kirbyheyborne.com)),
* [The Three Body Problem](http://kenliu.name/translations/three-body/) by [Liu Cixin](http://blog.sina.com.cn/lcx) (read by [Bruno Roubicek](http://t.co/GH0CYLuZtr)) and
* [Cryptonomicon](http://www.nealstephenson.com/cryptonomicon.html) by Neal Stephenson (read by [William Dufris](http://www.mindseyeproductions.com)).
