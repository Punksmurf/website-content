title: Now
---
This is what I am supposedly working on now. Last updated in March, 2018.

## General
* I'm a developer at [Infi](https://infi.nl), so that's were I spend most of my time actually making things.
* Almost six months ago I moved, and I am still unpacking. That's not as much an activity as the word implies, it's just… every now and then I unpack a few boxes and put their contents somewhere nicer.
* In my, what's it called? self-improvement-time at work (and my own free time) I am actually working on two (really small) games! Nothing to get *that* excited about for you I'm sure but it's been so long since I've done anything of the sort. I'm really glad I am doing it and I am even more or less on schedule! I'll put them on [Itch.io](https://punksmurf.itch.io/) when they're done so keep refreshing that page.
* We're also working on a nice coding dojo called [.NET Core ❤ OSX/Linux](https://www.meetup.com/Infi-Developers-Meetup/events/248885529/). During this dojo we'll get you started on using .NET Core on Linux or macOS with a nice project (Windows users are welcome too, but will not be taken seriously). We'd love to see you there!

## Reading
* [Procedural Generation in Game Design](https://www.crcpress.com/Procedural-Generation-in-Game-Design/Short-Adams/p/book/9781498799195). Each chapter is another case from practise by a different game designer, which makes it a really interesting read.

## Audiobooks
* [Abaddon's Gate](https://www.jamessacorey.com/books/abaddons-gate/) by James S.A. Corey (read by [Jefferson Mays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Mays)) and
* [Sherlock Holmes: The Definitive Collection](http://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Crime-Thrillers/Sherlock-Holmes-The-Definitive-Collection-Audiobook/B06X1BRZYC) by Arthur C. Doyle (read by the excellent [Stephen Fry](http://www.stephenfry.com/).
* Also, at times, [Red Wheelbarrow](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Crime-Thrillers/Mr-Robot-Red-Wheelbarrow-Audiobook/B01M9GJFO8), the book tie-in to [Mr. Robot](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158110/) by Courtney Looney and [Sam Esmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Esmail). It's a truly excellent listen, but can also be rather depressing. The narration by [Eve Lindley](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6843400/) is excellent and witty. And really appropriate, seeing as it's read from Hot Carla's point of view (this makes sense if you read the book).

## Playing
* [Lone Echo](http://www.readyatdawn.com/game-list/lone-echo/), which is so far (which is not really far) the best game I played in VR. Highly engaging, great use of VR and it allows you to set your own pace most of the time.

## Watching
* [Dirk Genly's Holistic Detectvie Agency](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4047038/) which is clever and funny and really like nothing else,
* [Limitless](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4422836/) for those days when I don't want to tax my brain too much,
* [Archer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1486217/) those days when I don't want to tax my brain too much and I don't have an hour to kill and
* [Collateral](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6729080/) which I actually just finished but really want to recommend. It's a great run and only about 4 hours total. The best thing about it is also a spoiler so I'm going to leave you hanging here.

This page was inspired by [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com), and other people who have one (or really the reverse, because that's how I found out).
