title: Now
---
This is what I am supposedly working on now. Last updated in March, 2018.

## General
* I'm a developer at [Infi](https://infi.nl), so thats were I spend most of my time actually making things.
* Almost six months ago I moved, and I am still unpacking. That's not as much an activity as the word implies, it's justâ€¦ every now and then I unpack a few boxes and put their contents somewhere nice.
* In my, what's it called? self-improvement-time at work (and at home) I am actually working on two (really small) games! Nothing to get really excited about for you I'm sure but it's been so long since I've done anything of the sort. I'm really glad I am doing it and I am even more or less on schedule! I'll put them on [Itch.io](https://punksmurf.itch.io/) when they're done so keep refreshing that page.

## Reading
* [Procedural Generation in Game Design](https://www.crcpress.com/Procedural-Generation-in-Game-Design/Short-Adams/p/book/9781498799195). Each chapter is another case from practise by a different game designer, which makes it a really interesting read.

## Audiobooks
* [Abaddon's Gate](https://www.jamessacorey.com/books/abaddons-gate/) by James S.A. Corey (read by [Jefferson Mays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Mays)) and
* [Sherlock Holmes: The Definitive Collection](http://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Crime-Thrillers/Sherlock-Holmes-The-Definitive-Collection-Audiobook/B06X1BRZYC) by Arthur C. Doyle (read by the excellent [Stephen Fry](http://www.stephenfry.com/).
* Also, at times, [Red Wheelbarrow](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Crime-Thrillers/Mr-Robot-Red-Wheelbarrow-Audiobook/B01M9GJFO8), the book tie-in to [Mr. Robot](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158110/) by Courtney Looney and [Sam Esmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Esmail). It's a truly excellent listen, but can also be rather depressing.

## Playing
* [Lone Echo](http://www.readyatdawn.com/game-list/lone-echo/), which is so far (which is not really far) the best game I played in VR. Highly engaging, great use of VR and it allows you to set your own pace most of the time.

## Watching
* [Dirk Genly's Holistic Detectvie Agency](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4047038/) which is clever and funny and really like nothing else,
* [Limitless](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4422836/) for those days when I don't want to tax my brain too much,
* [Archer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1486217/) those days when I don't want to tax my brain too much and I don't have an hour to kill and
* [Collateral](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6729080/) which I actually just finished but really want to recommend. It's a great run and only about 4 hours total. The best thing about it is also a spoiler so I'm going to leave you hanging here.

This page was inspired by [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com), and other people who have one (or really the reverse, because that's how I found out).
