title: Now
---
This is what I am supposedly working on now. Last updated in April, 2019.

## Work
* I'm a developer at [Infi](https://infi.nl), so that's were I spend most of my time actually making things.
* We were present at [Exec(ut)](https://execut.nl/), a conference for students. We wrote a small [blog post](https://infi.nl/nieuws/infi-sponsort-execut-2019/) about it, and soon we'll get a bigger one detailing our Space Invaders inspired game. It was a lot of fun (and hard work) to build, on a very diverse stack.

## Projects
* I recently wiped my server and wanted to started clean again; there were a lot of old projects on there with all sort of mess. I am now trying (with tiny steps) to get everything setup using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), which gets kind of interesting when you want to setup [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates. I may or may not give up – it's a nice puzzle but I'm not really invested in Ansible so my interest is limited.
* While setting everything back up, I discovered that, for some reason, [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) isn't as smooth an experience as it was before. Setting it up was a bit of a pain, plus NPM was telling me about vulnerabilities (jikes) although it wouldn't tell me which, so I'm rewriting it using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).
* I'm building another book case, isn't that nice. (Yes).

## Reading
* [Procedural Generation in Game Design](https://www.crcpress.com/Procedural-Generation-in-Game-Design/Short-Adams/p/book/9781498799195). Each chapter is another case from practise by a different game designer, which makes it a really interesting read.
* [Cryptonomicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptonomicon) by [Neil Stephenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson), it's a bit long winded and has a hard time getting to the point, but enjoyanble nonetheless. I think that goes for most of Stephenson's work.

## Audiobooks
* [Sherlock Holmes: The Definitive Collection](http://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Crime-Thrillers/Sherlock-Holmes-The-Definitive-Collection-Audiobook/B06X1BRZYC) by Arthur C. Doyle (read by the excellent [Stephen Fry](http://www.stephenfry.com/)). It's been here for a while, that's because it's really off and on. (Mosty off).
* [Zer0es](http://terribleminds.com/ramble/project/zer0es/) by [Chuck Wendig](http://terribleminds.com/). It's okay. Narrated by [Ray Chase](http://www.raychase.com/), who is very good.
* [Bright Ruin](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Bright-Ruin-Audiobook/B07BNRQXNX) by [Vic James](http://www.vicjames.co.uk/), the last part of the Dark Gifts series, read by [Avita Jay](http://avitajay.com/). It's an interesting mix of alternative history, fantasy, politics and action in a YA package. And it has some pretty good heroines, for some reason there are a lot more of those in YA literature than in the "grown up" stuff.

## Playing
* I recently caved and bought a Switch. I want to say that I'm having a lot of fun with Breath of the Wild and Mario Kart, but if I'm honest I am just spending _way_ to much time on [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) again, for which Switch is just the best platform.
* I loved the experimental nature of [What remains of Edith Finch](http://edithfinch.com/)! All those different mechanics were really cool, although I find they detracted a bit from the story for the most part. The fish factory though… I tell you, never did any game mechanic drive the story home like that one did. Respect.
* [Gone Home](https://gonehome.game/) is decidedly less pretty, but I found it much more engaging. If I could ever leave a legacy like that (haha no) I can die a peaceful person.

## Watching
* I'm rewatching [Altered Carbon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2261227/), just because it was awesome the first time and because I recenlty read the book and some parts are rather different.
* I've just finished [Scorpion](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3514324/), which is both terrible and hilarious (and sometimes tedious). If you're a bit of nerd, do yourself a favour and watch the first episode. It's amazing.
* [Firefly](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303461/). Because it's Firefly, why do you ask?
* It took me a few episodes to get into (because everyone kept saying it's awesome), but now I'm hooked on [Russian Doll](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7520794/). Because it is _awesome_! A sort of extra long, extra weird and extra not family friendly Doctor Who without the Doctor. Yeah okay it's its own thing all right.
* Speaking of, when is the last season of [Doctor Who](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006q2x0) coming to Netflix?! It feels like it's been _years_.
* [ES6 for Everyone](https://es6.io/) by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/), which is really awesome (he is great at video tutorials!) and makes me think there might be something to this JavaScript thing after al. Although [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) remains my one true love.


This page was inspired by [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com), and other people who have one (or really the reverse, because that's how I found out).
