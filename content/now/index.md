title: Now
---
This is what I am supposedly working on now. Last updated in June, 2017.

## General
* I'm a developer at [Infi](https://infi.nl), so thats were I spend most of my time actually making things.
* With some collegues we are playing neural networking and trying to get the hang of it. Luckily the software to do that is getting quite user friendly at this point, especially [Keras](https://keras.io) is amazing. Having just bought a gaming PC with a moderately powerful graphics card (a GTX 1060) helps too, because man is that stuff computationally intensive.
* I am reading [Domain Driven Design](https://www.bol.com/nl/p/domain-driven-design/1001004001984629/) by Eric Evans. It's a tough one to get trough, but also very inspiring.
* A for now secret project with Micha.
* Slowly adding content to this new website.
* Looking for a new house, which is rather more taxing than I would have imagined before.

## Reading
* Trying to work through my backlog of [Donald Duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Duck_(Dutch_comic_book) comics,
* [Makers](http://craphound.com/makers/download/) by Cory Doctorow,
* [Modernist Cuisine at Home](http://modernistcuisine.com/books/modernist-cuisine-at-home/) by [Nathan Myhrvold](http://www.nathanmyhrvold.com) and his team and
* [The Miniaturist](http://www.jessieburton.co.uk/the-miniaturist.html) by Jessie Burton.

## Audiobooks
* [Leviathan Wakes](http://www.jamessacorey.com/books/leviathan-wakes/) by James S.A. Corey (read by [Jefferson Mays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Mays)) and
* [Cryptonomicon](http://www.nealstephenson.com/cryptonomicon.html) by Neal Stephenson (read by [William Dufris](http://www.mindseyeproductions.com)).

## Playing
Nothing really. Any free time I'm spending on my computer is spent scouring [Funda](http://www.funda.nl) for a new home.

## Watching
* [Real Humans](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2180271/).

This page was inspired by [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com), and other people who have one (or really the reverse, because that's how I found out).
