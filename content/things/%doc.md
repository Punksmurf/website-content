To attract visitors to the stand of DOC Stap, an educational institution, we developed a game using which one (almost) literally has to get higher up. By pulling the ropes the players had to manoeuvre their virtual kite trough a sky filled with obstacles such as birds, thunderclouds and UFOs in order to fly as high as they could.
