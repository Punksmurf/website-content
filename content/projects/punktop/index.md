title: Building a palmtop from scratch
---
Because I have way too much time on my hands, love palmtops and think a new one is too expensive, I’ve decided to build my own (and call it a Punktop). It’s a bit of a long term project, so don’t hold your breath – you might not survive it.

I have written two posts on the subject. The last one was in August, 2016. Honestly, I’m still a bit stuck on which keyboard to use: the (more or less) cheap wireless ones are all pretty crappy and a bit too small and USB ones are too large (you get into laptop size territory there).

Here are my 2 posts. These are still the original Dutch versions, so if you’re not a Dutch speaker you’ll have to make do with Google Translate. Sorry.
